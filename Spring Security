Spring Security in Java:


Classes needed to implemet Spring Security is AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer.

Create your class and extend the above security class to create a Spring security filter chain in you application.

This AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer sets up a delegation proxy security for our application's entry point.


When you create a class that extends AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer, it creates a delegation proxy and looks out for securityfilterChain bean. So you need 
to create a bean for securityfilterChain. For this, create a java class and provide annotations -> @Configuration and @EnableWebSecurity. This @EnableWebSecurity annotation 
allows the Spring application itself create the securityfilterChain bean.  To get this @EnableWebSecurity annotation available in your application you need to add  
spring web config maven dependency in your pom.xml file.
